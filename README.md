# Module 21 Challenge

# Report

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help Alphabet Soup select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.

### Results

- Data Preprocessing

  - The target for this model is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`
  - The features of the model are:
    - `APPLICATION_TYPE`
    - `AFFILIATION`
    - `CLASSIFICATION`
    - `USE_CASE`
    - `ORGANIZATION`
    - `STATUS`
    - `INCOME_AMT`
    - `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`
    - `ASK_AMT`
  - The variables `EIN` and `NAME` should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features.

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  - The initial neural network model selected 80 neurons, 2 hidden layers, and uses `ReLU` & `sigmoid` activation functions. This is because the number of `X` features are 42. It is recommended to double or triple the number of neurons based on the number of features. The activation function `ReLU` was selected due to the features containing values starting from 0 to beyond. It is also a good starting point.
  - The model was not able to achieve the target model performance of 75%. It only reached an accuracy of 72.9%.

  - In order to increase model performance:
    - `ASK_AMT` feature is bucketed into two categories: 5000 & Others. When this doesn't show any improvement, `ASK_AMT` column is removed. It does not seem to affect the accuracy.
    - Number of neurons is increased to 168, 84, 42, 21, 1. The activation is varied from `ReLU`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid`. The hidden layers is increased to 4. However, all these only improved the accuracy to 73.1%

### Summary

In summary, the model only performed at 73% accuracy. It has a large percentage of loss at 56%. In general, to perform hyperparameter adjustment, we can try adding more neurons, layers, and epochs. We can also experiment with different activation functions. However, we can also utilise the latest automated model optimisation released in TensowFlow 2.0. This would take the guess work out for creating a nominal neural network and deep learning model.

# Background

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organisation, such as:

- **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
- **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
- **AFFILIATION**—Affiliated sector of industry
- **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organisation classification
- **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
- **ORGANIZATION**—Organisation type
- **STATUS**—Active status
- **INCOME_AMT**—Income classification
- **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**—Special considerations for application
- **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
- **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively

# Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `deep-learning-challenge`. **Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.**
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Deep Learning Challenge.
4. Push the above changes to GitHub.

# Files

Download the following files to help you get started:

# Instructions

# Step 1: Preprocess the Data

Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s `StandardScaler()`, you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Using the information we provided in the Challenge files, follow the instructions to complete the preprocessing steps.

1. Read in the `charity_data.csv` to a Pandas DataFrame, and be sure to identify the following in your dataset:
   - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
   - What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?
2. Drop the `EIN` and `NAME` columns.
3. Determine the number of unique values for each column.
4. For columns that have more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.
5. Use the number of data points for each unique value to pick a cutoff point to combine "rare" categorical variables together in a new value, `Other`, and then check if the replacement was successful.
6. Use `pd.get_dummies()` to encode categorical variables.
7. Split the preprocessed data into a features array, `X`, and a target array, `y`. Use these arrays and the `train_test_split` function to split the data into training and testing datasets.
8. Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a `StandardScaler` instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the `transform` function.

# Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organisation will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

1. Continue using the Jupyter Notebook in which you performed the preprocessing steps from Step 1.
2. Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.
4. If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
5. Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
6. Check the structure of the model.
7. Compile and train the model.
8. Create a callback that saves the model's weights every five epochs.
9. Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy.
10. Save and export your results to an HDF5 file. Name the file `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`.

# Step 3: Optimise the Model

Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimise your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

Use any or all of the following methods to optimise your model:

- Adjust the input data to ensure that no variables or outliers are causing confusion in the model, such as:
  - Dropping more or fewer columns.
  - Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
  - Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
- Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
- Add more hidden layers.
- Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
- Add or reduce the number of epochs to the training regimen.

**Note**: If you make at least three attempts at optimising your model, you will not lose points if your model does not achieve target performance.

1. Create a new Jupyter Notebook file and name it `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.ipynb`.
2. Import your dependencies and read in the `charity_data.csv` to a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Preprocess the dataset as you did in Step 1. Be sure to adjust for any modifications that came out of optimising the model.
4. Design a neural network model, and be sure to adjust for modifications that will optimise the model to achieve higher than 75% accuracy.
5. Save and export your results to an HDF5 file. Name the file `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.h5`.

# Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

1. **Overview** of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
2. **Results**: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
   - Data Preprocessing
     - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
     - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
     - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
   - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
     - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
     - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
     - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
3. **Summary**: Summarise the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
